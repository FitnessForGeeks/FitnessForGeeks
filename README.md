### Introduction
Our website 'Fitness For Geeks' helps people become the best version of themselves by monitoring their daily caloric intake. The user's Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) combined with his/her exercise pattern results in the optimal amount of calories per day - fitted to the user's goals. Besides tracking calories, our team is eager to develop customised trainingsplans. More upgrades and renovation, for instance to make the Profile Page more dynamic, are planned to be realeased in the future. Since our website is exclusively in English, we expect visitors from all around the world.

### Manual
There are a few things that need to be done before using our website.
First of all, go to the 'Website' folder
Before typing 'npm start' (in git bash for instance) you might need to install the node package manager first 'npm install'
After that start Visual Studio (for instance; C# needs to be compiled)
In Visual Studio start the Server-Project
Now the Database from the 'Database' folder has to be created by executing queries 
If you have followed all the steps correctly, you can start the project

### Known Issues
Verifying E-mail adress (user can use the website without verifying)
Using the website without specifying the required values for the TDEE will break the website
"Passwords do not match" message only disappears after clicking outside the input field (only if they match of course)    
When changing the title of the recipe the image on the server does not get renamed
